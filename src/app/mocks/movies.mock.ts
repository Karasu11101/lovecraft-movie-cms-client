    title: 'Shadow of the Unnamable',
    description: 'Set in New England in the late 1920s, two friends Randolph Carter and Joel Manton spend a sunny autumn afternoon in a remote 17th century cemetery. An argument arises, concerning the horror stories written by Carter especially one story that draws Manton\'s sarcasm. It\'s centered around a creature so horrifying, that it cannot be named or described: the Unnamable... Manton, as a schoolteacher and firm believer in science, can`t imagine anything that could be truly unnamable. Encouraged by the atmosphere of the old burial ground Carter tells his friend about the origin of the story. He claims it to be based on a local legend that is over 200 years old. A legend about a strange old man, who was rumored to have a terrible creature locked up in his attic. Manton listens with increasing fascination, as darkness descends on the cemetery, when suddenly they become part of the legend as well...',

    title: 'The Call of Cthulhu',
    description: 'The film begins with a dying professor who leaves his great-nephew a collection of documents pertaining to the Cthulhu Cult. The nephew (Matt Foyer) begins to learn why the study of the cult so fascinated his grandfather.

The nephew notes that Inspector Legrasse, who had directed the raid on cultists in backwoods Louisiana, died before the nephew\'s investigation began.

From there we watch as the strange Wilbur Whateley sits down with the Doctor, Nancy and her friend Elizabeth Hamilton (played by Donna Baccala), for a meal.

    description: 'A young stock market tycoon, Paul, has been plagued by strange dreams of a green-eyed mermaid. His girlfriend, Barbara, feels it is most likely an indication of excessive stress and tries to convince Paul to go on vacation with her and their older friends, Howard and Viki, to the sunny shores of Spain.

    title: 'The Whisperer in Darkness',
    description: 'For the first two acts, the plot largely follows the short story. The third act consists of entirely new material in which the Mi-Go are revealed to worship Shub-Niggurath, and the protagonist, Wilmarth, uncovers an attempt by cultists to open a gateway between Yuggoth and Earth. He foils the plot with the help of Hannah, the child of one of the collaborators. His escape is unsuccessful and at the end of the film the audience discovers that Wilmarth has been narrating from a machine attached to the cylinder in which his brain now resides. This differs from the original story in which Wilmarth flees in the middle of the night and safely returns to Arkham. According to Sean Branney on the making-of featurette "The Whisperer Behind the Scenes," Lovecraft was better at set-ups than endings. From a dramatic standpoint, Lovecraft\'s story brought the writers through what would be "Act Two" of a standard movie structure and felt incomplete. The character of Hannah and opening of gate to Yuggoth were introduced in order to \"[make it] a good movie\". Branney and Leman intended to make Wilmarth\'s world \"more emotionally complicated\" because Hannah\'s future caused him to be \"invested in more than just himself\". The characters of Wilmarth\'s three friends at Miskatonic University were developed from Call of Cthulhu role-playing characters created years before by Branney, Leman, and a friend. Regarding the introduction of a biplane, Leman commented, \"If you have monsters that fly, you have to have a dogfight with a biplane.\"',

The Resonator is a machine which allows whoever is within range to see beyond normal perceptible reality. His assistant, Dr. Crawford Tillinghast (Jeffrey Combs), activates the machine and soon sees strange creatures in the air. When he is bitten by one of them, he urges Pretorius to turn the machine off. However, the crazed Pretorius refuses. Events transpire to the point where Crawford panics, fleeing outside. When the police arrive, they find Pretorius decapitated. Crawford is subsequently arrested and accused of murder. Crawford is committed to a psychiatric ward, where he is treated by Dr. Katherine McMichaels (Barbara Crampton). After Crawford gives his account of Pretorius\' death, Katherine orders that Crawford undergo a CAT scan. It shows that Crawford\'s pineal gland is enlarged and growing. Convinced of Crawford\'s innocence, Katherine has him released to her custody. She plans on taking him back to Pretorius\' house and the Resonator. They are accompanied by Detective Bubba Brownlee (Ken Foree), who investigated Pretorius\' death.',

    title: 'Re-Animator',
    description: 'West arrives at Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts in order to further his studies as a medical student. He rents a room from fellow medical student Dan Cain and converts the house\'s basement into his own personal laboratory. West demonstrates his reanimating reagent to Dan by reanimating Dan\'s dead cat Rufus. The cat behaves viciously that night forcing Dan to kill it again before West reanimates what is left of it, convincing Dan that West\'s reagent works. Dan\'s fiancée Megan Halsey, daughter of the medical school\'s dean, walks in on this experiment and is horrified. Dan tries to tell the dean about West\'s success in reanimating the dead cat, but the dean does not believe him. When Dan insists, the dean implies that Dan and West have gone mad. Barred from the school, West and Dan sneak into the morgue to test the reagent on a human subject in an attempt to prove that the reagent works, and thereby salvage their medical careers. The corpse they inject comes back to life, but in a frenetic and violent zombie-like state. Dr. Halsey stumbles upon the scene and is killed by the reanimated corpse, which West then kills with a bone-saw. Excited at the prospect of working with a freshly dead specimen, West injects Dr. Halsey\'s body with his reanimating reagent. Dr. Halsey returns to life, also in a zombie-like state. Megan chances upon the scene, and is hysterical. Dan collapses in shock. ',
